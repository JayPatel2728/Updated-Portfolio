            Currently studying Computer Science (Co-op) at Toronto Metropolitan University. I have an interest in cloud computing and building Full Stack applications with React, Node.js and Javascript which can be viewed on my portfolio website. I am also proficient in Java and Python. I firmly feel that the skills I have gained fromÂ the challenging environment and competitive university life define who I am, and I strive to use and improve them in any opportunity I receive.
